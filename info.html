    <div class="Info2" <p>I've been doing YouTube since I was around 8, It wasn't on this channel but on previous
        channels, (i wont be giving the channel names) So I have some past experience on what not to do. On previous
        channels I went from playing outside, to lego animations, to video games (trust me, I was bad) I also have some
        friends that do YouTube with me such as <a
